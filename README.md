## 7CUSMNDA-2025-Coursework

### **Part 1: Wikidata Editor Networks**
This section focuses on building and analyzing social interaction networks from Wikidata talk pages. Tasks include:
- **A. Network Construction**: Generating editor networks from CSV logs of user-thread-page interactions.
- **B. Network Metrics**: Analyzing structure using degree, clustering, centrality, and small-world characteristics.
- **C. Epidemic Simulations**: Simulating SIR model dynamics to trace controversial behavior spread.
- **D. Network Comparison**: Evaluating topological differences between small, medium, and large networks.

### **Part 2: Spatial Network and Provenance in Leeds**
This section uses geospatial and semantic data for practical urban analytics. Tasks include:
- **A. Road Network Construction**: Extracting a 1 km² road graph from Leeds using OpenStreetMap data.
- **B. Accident Analysis**: Exploring spatial clustering of road accidents using GlobalAutoK, Moran’s I, and proximity metrics.
- **C. Voronoi Planning**: Designing marathon zones using network-based Voronoi diagrams and identifying viable 42 km loops.
- **D. Provenance and Embeddings**: Modelling event provenance using the W3C PROV standard and evaluating the graph using PageRank and link prediction models (TransE, RotatE, CompGCN).
